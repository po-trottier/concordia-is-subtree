# Is Subtree Algorithm

This algorithm whether a tree is a subtree of another bigger tree by using no library calls. 

The algorithm assumes that all the elements in the tree are unique and doesn't validate that the "subtree" is smaller than the parent tree.

**This algorithm was developed as part of the *Data Structures and Algorithms* course given at Concordia University.**
